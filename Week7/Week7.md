*Week 7 Reading*

 I think that the PNAS street-network sprawl paper was very informative, especially since planning school runs the risk of being too America-centric with their 
 knowledge production, so a global perspective was certainly welcomed. I think that I was most surprised by how street network connectivity has declined worldwide 
 over the past couple of decades, and that there are few places that are doing a better job of street connectivity than they were in the past. I think that because 
 the United States is at such an extreme end of the spectrum, it clouded my judgement that the rest of the world practiced exceptional street design. It is 
 concerning that Type E (circuitous) in street design has grown by 8% between 2000 and 2014, however policies suggested such as allowing future street designs to be 
 only gridded. 

Questions:

Are there any differences between countries who drive on different sides of the road and street connectivity?
