# Week 3 Reading Assignment 


"Off the Grid.. and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design" reminded me of a   
book that I read as a child called Squirrel Park, a book that implicitly influenced my decisioon to go to planning school. 
It was a book about a boy whose neighborhood was about to have a new park constructed. The planners wanted to have a park 
with paths that were straight, but the kid's squirrel friend nibbles the architect's tools and the park eventually gets 
designed with curving paths. I remember as a kid thinking that curved street design were better than grid pattens because
they were more creative, however as an adult from a mobility justice standpoint, the lack of grids, 4 way intersections, 
and orientation of the street impairs the mobility of non able-bodied folx, the elderly, people with strollers, as well as 
increasing VMT and GHG emissions. The work also influences my research in reimagining TODs, looking at the numbers the
amount of gridded streets in America are about 0.09 less than prewar levels, so not only is it important to provide 
affordable housing near transit, but in order to reduce GHG emissions we must also have a gridded street pattern around 
the infill development. It was nice to see some spatial data that backed it up. The data that impressed me the 
most was the calculation of griddedness across states, I would have thought that New England would have a higher 
concentration of grids due to traditional urban street patterns, however I did not know that the geography of New England
would have contributed to the rural roads bringing down the average of urban areas in places like Vermont and New 
Hampshire.

The questions I would ask Geoff Beoing include:
